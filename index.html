                My Name Is Muhammad Ayuba Isa, I'm a Student of The University of Abuja, A Video Game Enthusiast, An Aspiring Software developer, And a Lover of Classical Literature. <br>

                My Journey In Tech Started When I First Emotionally Invested In Video Games I'd Spend Most of My Time Fiddling With Phones and Playing Different kinds Of Games 
                But at That point I didn't Know or Understood What a developer Was i didn't start up wanting to be a developer actually i looked up to a completely different field at the time,
                I Wanted to Become a Doctor. <br>
                 At a Point I Thought My Interest Would Lead Me Into Engeneering but i avoided the route because i wasnt the brightest in math class 
                and so is stuck to medicine and after a few trial and errors i gave up and decided to go for the easiest course i knew of so i applied to the computer scince program of the University of Abuja and i got accepted
                I didn't know a thing about programming back then so i went on youtube and started checking out python i was fascinated, you mean i can actually write how a device or app behaves with this so i was already invested by the time school had started
                so i was a bit dissapointed when i learned that our lecturers would only be teaching us the theory aspect nonetheless i kept going and decided to learn HTML, CSS before completeing Python.

            My Future Plans:
        </h2>
        <p>
            I plan on becoming a fullstack developer with more focus on the backend aspect of things and also become able to secure apps and websites so essentially a fullstack dev with security knowledge.
            my aim is the same as most developers a top company or a good paying start-up because everyone needs the money, its not all about it tho because i belive i have been deeply captivated by the world of programming except the 3am debbuging part that sucks.
